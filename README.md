# Android Exploit Framework
## Compile
1. Make sure Android SDK is installed on your system, and set $ANDROID_SDK_PATH environment path point to the path of the Android SDK.
2. Modify the $JAVA_HOME environment path in `scripts/jar2dex.bat` (for Windows) or `scripts/jar2dex.sh` (for Linux & macOS) point to the path of a Java 8 instance, if you do not have Java 8 on your system you can use one in Android Studio (e.g. `~/Applications/Android Studio/jre`). 
3. (Optional) You can modify the `scripts/jar2dex.bat` (for Windows) or `scripts/jar2dex.sh` (for Linux & macOS) to change the Android Build tools version we used (default is 30.0.3 now).
5. Run `gradle jar makeDex`, you can also use IDEs such as Android Studio or IDEA to build.

## Usage
1. Push the `run.sh` and `./build/libs/ExploitFramework.dex` in your Android device
2. Use `sh run.sh` to start, you can type `help` command for help.
